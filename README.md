# Minimal-UART-CPU Emulator (for Board Revision 1.2)
Emulate a Minimal UART CPU system in real-time in under 250 lines of C++ code.
Infos on the corresponding hardware built (EEPROM version): https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-UART-Computer

I write a cycle exact real-time emulator for a real CPU system in C++ in about 250 lines of code and explain things along the way as good as I can. I am sure there are bugs or improvements to find. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Watch my other videos about the Minimal UART CPU and minimal 8-bit CPU design on my YouTube channel.

Update: The instruction set is now compatible with the Minimal UART Computer (FLASH Edition).

Added a keyboard input thread. Todo: add Linux support to mykeys.h
